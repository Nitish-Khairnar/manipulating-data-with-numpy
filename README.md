### Project Overview

 We have IPL DATA set for a particular seasomn and based on it there are some pretty interesting question we need to solves using the NumPy array.


### Learnings from the project

 The foremost takeaway for me in this project is that through Numpy we can avoid so many complex code like list comprehensions and various loops.
Numpy makes our code more user friendly and very readilable, a third person going through it will get it very quickly.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 So, initally I tried solving the problems through conventional method using loops and boolean. As I proceeded further with the concept of Numpy, I started using the Numpy formulas more and the coding went quite easy afterwards.


### Challenges faced

 The moremost challenge I faced was I was getting the lofic correct, but to put in a correct way, correct syntax was a bit difficult for me.
Google helped me a lot, specially Stack Overflow.


### Additional pointers

 Yes, for any given solution, there might be 2 or more way to get it, whichever we find it easy, we should go by it. no matter even if the other person's code looks more of high standard. For us, getting the concept right matters the most.
